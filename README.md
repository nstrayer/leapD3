#Leap Motion + D3.js

[Hosted Example](http://www.uvm.edu/~nstrayer/leapD3)

This is an experimental repo to get d3 interfaced with the leap motion using the new leap motion skeletal tracking javascript API. 


__Future direction:__ Using machine learning to teach the leap different gestures for interacting with D3 graphics.
